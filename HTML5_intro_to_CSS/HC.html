            <h1>Chattanooga: Past and Present</h1>
            <h2>A City Steeped in History:</h2>
            <p>
                Chattanooga has a rich and fascinating history that has shaped it into the vibrant city it is today. Originally inhabited by Native American tribes, the area later became an important site during the Civil War. The Battle of Chattanooga in 1863 was a turning point in the war, as Union forces gained control of the region, helping to secure their victory. Today, visitors can explore this history at the Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park, which preserves battlefields and provides insight into the struggles faced by soldiers on both sides. Beyond its wartime past, Chattanooga became a key industrial hub in the 20th century, known for its railroads and manufacturing. The famous song "Chattanooga Choo Choo" immortalized the city’s role in train travel, and the historic Terminal Station remains a beloved landmark.
