            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>Welcome! This is basically my personal space to keep track of what I'm currently listening to. I don't claim to have the most refined or well-rounded tasteâ€”this is just a collection of artists, songs, and albums that I love. If you're looking for recommendations, feel free to poke around and maybe find something new to listen to!</p>

            <h2>My Music Taste (A Rough Overview)</h2>
            <p>My listening habits lean heavily toward indie rock, folk, and whatever weird mix of sounds grabs my attention. Expect a lot of concept albums and songs and unique vocalists. If an album resonates with me emotionally or simply gets stuck in my head, I'm likely to put it here.</p>
